# Evolution

An exploration of the BioMorph ideas developed by Richard Dawkins in [The Blind Watchmaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker) presented as a native application for OS X (Mac) and iOS (iPhone or iPad).

Some essential portions of the code are adapted from [this similar BioMorph project](http://www.emergentmind.com/biomorphs) by EmergentMind.
